    	<p>In the very early Alpha releases of Cayenne we recommended $JRE_HOME/lib/ext
    	as one of the places where Cayenne can be installed. This recommendation IS NO LONGER VALID. 
    	Here is an extract from the current installation procedure:</p>

		<p><i>It is NOT recommended putting Cayenne JAR files under JRE extensions directory 
		($JRE_HOME/lib/ext or $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext), though it will probably work in some cases. 
		The reason for that is that classes loaded from extensions directory have their own ClassLoader 
		and can't directly access resources associated with other ClassLoaders. Cayenne allows to 
		"bootstrap" other ClassLoaders for the purpose of resource lookup, but this requires extra 
		code and doesn't solve all problems.</i>
