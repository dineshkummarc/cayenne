<title>Frequently Asked Questions: Develop with Cayenne</title>

    <section name="FAQ 3: Develop with Cayenne">
    	<subsection name="Q 3.1 What databases are currently supported?" 
		anchor="db">
    	
    	<p>Almost any database that has a JDBC driver will work with Cayenne. But there are
    	certain database specific issues that arise mostly when doing schema operations. This is 
    	discussed in detail <a href="../userguide/design/crossdb.html">here</a>. Having said that, 
    	Cayenne is tested and proven to be 100% compatible with 
    	the following engines:
    	<ul> 
    		<li><a href="http://oracle.com/">Oracle</a> (8, 8i, 9i)</li>
    		<li><a href="http://www.sybase.com/">Sybase (11.9)</a></li>
    		<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a></li>
    		<li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> (7.3 and newer)</li>
    		<li><a href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/">HSQLDB</a></li>
    		<li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/db2/">DB2</a></li>
    		<li><a href="http://firebird.sourceforge.net/">FireBird (Interbase)</a></li> 
    	</ul>
    	
    	Adapters for other engines are constantly added. Users can create their own adapters as well.

    	<panel name="Note on MS SQLServer adapter:">SybaseAdapter works pretty well with SQLServer. 
    	A separate adapter maybe created in the future.

    	<subsection name="Q 3.2 How do I log an output of a single query?" 
		anchor="log_query">
    	
    	<p>Cayenne logging system is based on Jakarta 
    	<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/">Log4J</a> package.
    	To increase logging level of the execution of a 
    	single select query do something like this:</p>
    	
<source>
  SelectQuery selectQuery = ...;
  selectQuery.setLoggingLevel(org.apache.log4j.Level.WARN);
  List objects = dataContext.performQuery(selectQuery);
</source>
		<p>To increase logging level of a commit execution do this:</p>
<source>
  dataContext.commitChanges(org.apache.log4j.Level.WARN);
</source>
    	</subsection>
    	
    	<subsection name="Q 3.3 I am on MySQL and I keep getting 'Can't disable AUTO_COMMIT' error. How do I fix it?" 
		anchor="auto_commit">
    	
    	<p>Errors like the one below may happen when using an outdated MySQL JDBC driver:</p>
    	<pre>java.sql.SQLException: Cannot disable AUTO_COMMIT
	at org.gjt.mm.mysql.Connection.setAutoCommit(Connection.java:396)
	at org.objectstyle.cayenne.conn.ConnectionWrapper.setAutoCommit(ConnectionWrapper.java:343)
	at org.objectstyle.cayenne.access.DataNode.performQueries(DataNode.java:245)
    	</pre>
    	
    	<p>Though MySQL technically does not support transactions (stable release
    	as of this writing), call to "setAutoCommit" is completely legitimate and shouldn't fail.
    	Downloading the latest stable driver from <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/connector-j/index.html">MySQL 
    	website</a> should fix this problem.</p>
    	</subsection>
    	
        <subsection name="Q 3.4 How do I select objects that do not have a certain other object in its to-many relationship?" 
		anchor="not-query">
    	
    	<p>Sometimes there is a need to find all objects that DO NOT have a certain object (or objects) 
    	on the other side of their to-many relationship. From the SQL standpoint, an inner join will not 
    	produce the right results. Rather a subquery is normally used. In Cayenne you can do this in a 
    	simple two step process. Lets take the following example. There is a Project class and a Task class.
    	Project has many tasks. We need to fetch all projects that do not contain a task with type "Database".</p>
    	
		<p>The most obvious, but incorrect solution:</p>    	
<source>
DataContext ctxt;
...
Expression qualifier = ExpressionFactory.noMatchExp("taskArray.type", "Database");
List projects = ctxt.performQuery(new SelectQuery(Project.class, qualifier));
</source>

		<p>Correct solution:</p>    	
<source>
DataContext ctxt;
...
Expression qualifier = ExpressionFactory.matchExp("taskArray.type", "Database");
List excludeProjects = ctxt.performQuery(new SelectQuery(Project.class, qualifier));
List projects = ctxt.performQuery(new SelectQuery(Project.class));

// filter out projects that do not satisfy criteria
projects.removeAll(excludeProjects);
</source>
