        	<p>JDBC specification was created by Sun to provide a uniform
        	way of connecting to relational databases from the Java code.
        	In theory this should allow Java developer to create database-aware
        	code that is portable across RDBMS vendors. In reality this is only partially 
        	true. While providing universal connectivity, JDBC doesn't handle
        	certain portability issues. The following problems 
        	remain when developing with JDBC:</p>
        	
        	<ul>
        		<li>There is no fully standard-compliant databases (even though all
        		of them claim to be). Certain "standard" features may not be implemented
        		in some RDBMS.
        		</li>
        		<li>SQL syntax may vary across RDBMS. Things like outer join queries,
        		database objects creation, BLOB handling, etc. are handled differently
        		by different vendors. 
        		</li>
        		<li>Vendors provide their own extensions of SQL and JDBC functionality.
        		Taking advantage of these extensions and creating portable code at the 
        		same time is not a trivial task.
        		</li>
        	</ul>
        	
        	<p>
        	This becomes even a bigger problem in a generic product like Cayenne that should
        	support any database. Therefore Cayenne provides <a href=
        	"../../api/org/objectstyle/cayenne/dba/package-overview.html">DbAdapter 
        	architecture</a> as a way of handling database differences. It works in 
        	conjunction with JDBC. 
        	</p>
