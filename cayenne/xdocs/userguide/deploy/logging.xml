           <subsection name="13.6 Configuring Logging">
            <p>Cayenne logging is based on <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">Log4J
            package</a> from Jakarta Apache Project. This is the most powerful and flexible logging 
            framework available in Java. Log4J configuration is normally done using a property file. 
            Later in this chapter we explain how Cayenne loads configuration files and how to customize this process.
            Format of the entries in this file is described in the <a 
            href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/manual.html">Log4j documentation</a>. 
            Here is a sample configuration file contents:</p>
<source>
# General Log4J stuff
log4j.rootLogger=WARN, A1
log4j.appender.A1=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.A1.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.A1.layout.ConversionPattern=cayenne %-5p [%t %d{MM-dd HH:mm:ss}] %c{1}: %m%n

# indiv. packages configuration - turning on the packages that we care about
#log4j.logger.org.objectstyle.cayenne = INFO

# This is the logger that controls SQL output
# Setting the level to INFO or DEBUG will turn the logs on
log4j.logger.org.objectstyle.cayenne.access.QueryLogger = INFO
</source>
            
            <panel name="Users of Other Logging Frameworks:">
            If your application uses another package for its own logging purposes 
            (like JDK 1.4 java.util.logging, or commons-logging from Jakarta), 
            Cayenne Log4J-based logging will not interfere with your other logging configurations.
            </panel>
            
            <panel name="Log4J Users:">
            If your application already uses Log4J, you may need to disable Cayenne logging
            configuration and put Cayenne logger entries in your existing configuration file
            loaded elsewhere. Disabling automatic logging configuration by Cayenne is described below.
            </panel>
            
            <subsection name="13.6.1 Essential Loggers.">
            <p><strong>SQL Tracing.</strong>
            Very important logging feature of Cayenne is tracing the execution of SQL statements. 
            If configured appropriately, Cayenne will log opened connections, 
            executed queries, and DDL statements. This is extremely important in understanding
            what is going on in the application, tracing bugs, etc. Logger that is responsible for SQL logging
            is "org.objectstyle.cayenne.access.QueryLogger". Its default logging level is INFO, so the following
            lines in the configuration file will turn it on or off:</p>
            
<source># Turn SQL tracing on
log4j.logger.org.objectstyle.cayenne.access.QueryLogger = INFO
</source>

<source>
# Turn SQL tracing off, e.g. to increase performance
log4j.logger.org.objectstyle.cayenne.access.QueryLogger = WARN
</source>

			<p>When SQL tracing is turned off, it is possible to log the execution of only certain queries
			or commits by manually increasing the logging level of just a specific query above the level configured
			for the QueryLogger. This is a very convenient feature for debugging the code, since it reduces the level 
			of noise in the logs, focusing attention on the queries that are important. This API is <a 
			href="../../faq/develop.html#log_query">discussed in the FAQ</a>.</p>
			
			
			<p><strong>Tracing Configuration Loading.</strong> Cayenne XML files may contain errors, or maybe missing
			or inaccessible by the application; there maybe lots of other reasons why Cayenne fails to startup, from 
			missing JDBC drivers to misspelled database URLs. To trace configuration loading process, you will need to
			turn on the following loggers:</p>
			
<source>
log4j.logger.org.objectstyle.cayenne.conf = DEBUG
log4j.logger.org.objectstyle.cayenne.util = DEBUG
</source>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="13.6.2 Default Configuration">
            <p>Default behaviour of Cayenne is to look for a file called <code>cayenne-log.properties</code>, 
            first in the directory $HOME/.cayenne/, then in the CLASSPATH. $HOME is a system specific home directory of a user
            running the application. If you don't know what it is, try printing it from Java like this:
            <code>System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.home"))</code>.</p>
            
            <p>If you don't explicitly create this file,
            Cayenne will use the one included in cayenne.jar (and therefore guaranteed to be in the CLASSPATH).
            This means - <strong>no special logging configuration is required</strong>, Cayenne will just work out of the box.
            </p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="13.6.3 Custom Configuration File">
            <p>If you are not satisfied with the default location or default file name of the logging configuration,
            you can supply your own:</p>
 
<source>// Obtain the URL of the custom configuration file
java.net.URL url = ....;

// configure cayenne logging
// note that URL can be null, resulting in default settings
org.objectstyle.cayenne.conf.Configuration.configureCommonLogging(url);
</source>

			<p>It is important to execute this code <strong>before</strong> any calls to Cayenne are made in
			the application, or otherwise it will have no effect on logging.
            </p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="13.6.4 Configuring Log4J outside of Cayenne.">
            <p>Finally, if your application already uses Log4J and implements its own logic to configure logging,
            it would be undesirable for Cayenne to invoke its default behavior and override any application settings. Also
            it is convenient to use a single logging configuration file per application. This will require to disable
            any attempts by Cayenne to reconfigure logging settings.
            </p>
<source>
// disable logging configuration attempts by Cayenne
org.objectstyle.cayenne.conf.Configuration.setLoggingConfigured(true);
</source>

			<p>It is important to execute this code <strong>before</strong> any calls to Cayenne are made in
			the application.
