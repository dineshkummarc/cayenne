			<subsection name="12.5 Deployment with Ant">
				<p>There is a number of cases when it is highly desirable to 
					automate changing of Cayenne configuration files, including 
					<code>cayenne.xml</code> and driver information files:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i>Changing connection information when porting an 
						application from one environment to another:</i> 
						Deployment environment uses different information for 
						the database connections from what was used in 
						development.</li>
					<li><i>Deployment of Cayenne libraries:</i> Third party 
						Cayenne libraries may contain DataMaps and business 
						classes, but they normally do not have 
						<code>cayenne.xml</code> file, since ultimate 
						deployment configuration is unknown when the library is 
						created.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Cayenne provides an Ant task called <code>cdeploy</code> 
					that takes care of such things. More information on 
					<code>cdeploy</code> is available <a 
					href="../ant/cdeploy.html">here</a>.</p>
