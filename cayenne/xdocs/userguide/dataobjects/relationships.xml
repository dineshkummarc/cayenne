    	<p>"Get" methods for to-one relationships return the target DataObject.
    	If the object is not in memory yet, it will be fetched on demand. 
    	Modifying to-one relationships is no different from modifying attributes 
    	- just simple call to a "set" method:
    	</p>

<source>
Painting painting;

// obtain artist for a given painting
Artist originalArtist = painting.getToArtist();

// replace with a new artist
Artist newArtist = (Artist)context.createAndRegisterNewObject("Artist");
painting.setToArtist(newArtist);

// or temporarily remove Artist at all...
// painting.setToArtist(null);

    	<panel name="Note:">
		When adding or removing an object from any kind of relationship, Cayenne will
		locate and modify an existing reverse relationship as appropriate.

		<subsection name="8.1.2 To-Many Relationships"> 	
    	<p>"Get" methods for <strong>to-many</strong> relationships return Lists of DataObjects. 
    	Just like individual DataObjects, such lists are also resolved on demand (e.g. when 
    	a user tries to read an element from the list). For modification there are special 
    	"addTo..." and "removeFrom..." methods:
    	</p>
    	
<source>
Artist artist;

// obtain a list of paintings
List paintings = artist.getPaintingArray();

// remove the first painting
if(paintings.size() > 0) {
   Painting firstPainting = (Painting)paintings.get(0);
   artist.removeFromPaintingArray(firstPainting);
}

// add a new painting
Painting newPainting = (Painting)context.createAndRegisterNewObject("Painting");
artist.addToPaintingArray(newPainting);
