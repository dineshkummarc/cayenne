    	<p>DataObjects can have simple properties (also called "attributes",
    	e.g. String, Number, or Date attributes) or relationships to 
    	other DataObjects or collections of DataObjects. Application will 
    	read and modify DataObjects properties simply by calling 
    	corresponding set/get methods. Examples of working with
    	DataObject attributes and relationships are given in this chapter.
