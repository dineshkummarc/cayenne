        <subsection name="1.1 Guide to 1.1 Features">
        	<p>Cayenne version 1.1 introduces a large number of new features and enhancements
        	over 1.0. This chapter lists most of them, providing the links to more detailed 
        	information about each feature.</p>
        	
        	<subsection name="1.1.1 DTD Additions.">
        	<p>"cayenne.xml" and "*.map.xml" file formats were updated to support new features. 1.1 DTD files
        	are located here:</p>
        	
        	<ul>
           	 	<li><a href="../../dtd/cayenne-project-1_1.dtd">cayenne-project-1_1.dtd</a></li>
            	<li><a href="../../dtd/cayenne-data-map-1_1.dtd">cayenne-data-map-1_1.dtd</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Upgrade Warning: be careful - saving projects with CayenneModeler v.1.1 will render them uneditable 
            with CayenneModeler v.1.0.</p>
            </subsection>
            
        		<subsection name="1.1.2 Advanced Local and Distributed Caching">
            <p>Cayenne now provides a way to share its object cache between DataContexts in the same
            JVM and across JVMs. The following chapters in the user guide describe this feature:</p>
            
            <ul>
           	 	<li><a href="../design/dataobjects-datarows.html">How Information Is Stored in Cayenne</a></li>

            		<li><a href="../perform/caching-lookup.html">Caching Lookup Tables</a></li>
            </ul>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.3 Optimistic Locking">
            <p>ObjAttributes and ObjRelationships can be marked to be used for "optimistic" locking.
            If an corresponding columns of the underlying database row are externally modified, an attempt
            to save an object results in OptimisticLockingException.</p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.4 Entity Inheritance">
            <p>Cayenne now supports entity inheritance for entities rooted in the same DB table (single 
            table inheritance).</p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.5 Data Views and DVModeler">
            <p><a href="../dataview/index.html">Data Views</a> is a completely new addition to Cayenne. 
            This is a framework and a Swing modeler tool to quickly build Swing applications based on 
            Cayenne.</p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.6 Generic Multithreaded and Distributed Events Mechanism">
            <p>Cayenne now includes a <a href="../design/events.html">generic package</a> 
            "org.objectstyle.cayenne.event" for registering listeners 
            and sending events, both locally and remotely. It supports both blocking and non-blocking
            listeners and dispatches. Supported remote transports include JMS and JavaGroups.</p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.7 DataObjects Validation">
            <p>DataContext now performs validation of DataObjects before committing them.
            There is a set of default validation checks being executed, based on the DataMap
            information. Developers can override DataObject validation methods to provide custom 
            validation checks.</p>
            
            <p>See user guide <a href="../dataobjects/validation.html">chapter on object validation</a>.</p>
            
            <p>Original implementation was submitted by Fabricio Voznika.</p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.9 Expression API Enhancements">
            <p>There is a new expression parser that allows creation of complex expressions from 
            strings ("Expression.fromString(..)"). This greatly reduces the amount of code needed to build an
            expression. 
            </p><p>
            In-memory evaluation API is improved, and now supports 
            both boolean conditions (via "Expression.match" method) and generic expressions evaluation 
            (via "Expression.evaluate" method), it also includes support for arithmetic operations.</p>
            
            <ul>

            </ul>
            </subsection>
            
			<subsection name="1.1.10 SQLTemplate - A Dynamic Raw SQL Query">
            <p>SQLTemplate replaces SqlSelectQuery and SqlModifyQuery and is a scriptable
            parameterized raw SQL query. It supports DataObjects and other features declared
            in GenericSelectQuery interface.
            </p>

            </ul>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.11 Support for Shared Mapping Mamespace">
            <p>DataDomain now provides a shared mapping namespace. This means that all mapping 
            objects can reference other mapping objects outside their DataMaps. For example two DbEntities
            can be located in different DataMaps and still have relationships to each other.</p>
            
            <p>Temporary limitation of the shared mapping namespace is that Queries stored in the DataMap 
            can't have a "root"  from a different DataMap.</p>
            </subsection>

            <p></p>
            </subsection>
            
			<subsection name="1.1.14 Entity Restricting Qualifier ">
            <p>ObjEntities now can hold a qualifier expression that is automatically appended to any 
            query qualifiers, thus creating a global data filter for a given entity. This feature is used for
            inheritance mapping, however it has nothing to do with inheritance as such and can be used
            all by itself.</p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.15 Explicit Transaction API and Container Managed Transactions">
            <p>Cayenne now supports container-managed transactions. As a result it can be used inside EJBs
            out of the box. It also allows a high degree of transactions customization. The following user guide 
            chapter explains Transactions design and behavior in details:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><a href="../design/transactions.html">Understanding Transactions</a></li>
            </ul>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.16 Various Performance Enhancements">
            <ul>
            	<li>Lazy Relationship Creation - when new objects are fetched, their relationships
            	are not initialized immediately; a Fault singleton is used isntead as a placeholder.
            	Of course in the past Cayenne also had "lazy" relationships, meaning that they didn't
            	get resolved via a DB query until accessed. Current optimization goes further -
            	it prevents a number of Java objects (such as empty Lists for to-many relationship, or
            	"hollow" DataObjects for to-ones)
            	from being created until absolutely necessary.</li>
            	
            	<li>To-many relationships do not have to be fully resolved on modification - if an 
            	unresolved to-many
            	relationship is modified (i.e. an object is added or removed from it), it is
            	not resolved until the next "read" (i.e. until a call to "size()" or "iterator()" method).
            	This is especially helpful with bi-directional one-to-many relationships.
            	E.g. "painting.addToArtist(artist)" used to trigger the fetch of all paintings
            	that belong to an artist. Not anymore.</li>
            </ul>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.17 DbAdapters for More Databases">
            <p>Cayenne features new database adapters:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>OpenBase Adapter</li>
            	<li>MS SQL Server Adapter</li>
            </ul>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.18 Support for To-One Relationships Not Pointing to a PK.">
            <p>Added support for one-to-one relationships between PK and non-PK columns
            of related tables. In the past this could only be modeled as one-to-many. CayenneModeler
            will create UNIQUE constraint for a non-PK columns during schema generation.</p>
            </subsection>

            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.20 Support for Queries in CayenneModeler and DataMap DTD.">
            <p>Queries are made first-class mapping objects. They can be modeled in CayenneModeler 
            and stored in DataMaps. Application code can then reuse such queries.
            </p>

            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.24 CayenneModeler ObjRelationship Mapping Dialog Redesign.">
            <p>A dialog used to select mapping of ObjRelationship to one DbRelationship (simple relationship)
            or to a series of DbRelationships (flattened relationship) had arbitrary limitations on what path 
            can be selected. This dialog has been completely redesigned to remove this limitation.</p>
            </subsection>
            
            <subsection name="1.1.25 CayenneModeler Productivity Enhancements.">
            <p>CayenneModeler now uses defaults where appropriate when working with mappings. This is
            to reduce manual operations. Some examples are:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>When ObjRelationship target is selected, Modeler guesses underlying DbRelationship if
            source and target entities can be connected in one step.</li>
            </ul>
