    <section name="9. Using Stored Procedures">
	<p>In addition to mapping database tables and views as entities, Cayenne allows mapping
	and executing database stored procedures. Just like table structure is described by DbEntities,
	stored procedures are described by <a 
	href="../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/map/Procedure.html">Procedure</a> class. Stored
	procedures are executed using <a 
	href="../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/query/ProcedureQuery.html">ProcedureQuery</a>,
	as described in the following chapters.</p>
	
	<panel name="Note:">
		Currently CayenneModeler does not support GUI mapping of stored procedures. Other than
		that, stored procedures are supported just like normal entities. They can be added to 
		DataMaps, saved and restored from XML. GUI support is coming. For now Procedure objects
		have to be created in the code, or (preferred) by editing DataMap XML files.
