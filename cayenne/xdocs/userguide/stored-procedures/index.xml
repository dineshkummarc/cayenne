    <section name="9. Using Stored Procedures">
	<p>In addition to mapping database tables and views as entities, Cayenne allows mapping
	and executing database stored procedures. Just like table structure is described by DbEntities,
	stored procedures are described by <a 
	href="../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/map/Procedure.html">Procedure</a> class. 
	Stored procedures are created using CayenneModeler, and are executed using <a 
	href="../../api/cayenne/org/objectstyle/cayenne/query/ProcedureQuery.html">ProcedureQuery</a>,
	as described in the following chapters.</p>
