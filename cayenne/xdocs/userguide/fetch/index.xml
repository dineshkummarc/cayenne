    <section name="7. Using SelectQueries">      
	<p>To give users access to the existing database data, Cayenne
        provides extensive query API. Queries in Cayenne are Java objects
        that create abstraction independent from the SQL dialect used by the target database.
        One of the goals of Query API is to provide queries in terms of Java objects and their
        properties (attributes and relationships) instead of SQL tables and columns.</p>
        
        <p>Cayenne also provides a way to execute direct SQL statements, to allow users to
        run the queries that are not covered by Cayenne or simply can not be expressed in terms 
        of Java objects. This is done using wrapper Query objects that contain arbitrary
        SQL strings: <a href=
