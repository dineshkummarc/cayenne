	<p>To give users access to the existing database data, Cayenne
       provides extensive query API. Queries in Cayenne are Java objects
       that create abstraction independent from the SQL dialect used by the target database.
       One of the goals of Query API is to provide queries in terms of Java objects and their
       properties (attributes and relationships) instead of SQL tables and columns.</p>
        
        <p>In addition Cayenne provides ways to run arbitrary SQL statements as queries.</p>
