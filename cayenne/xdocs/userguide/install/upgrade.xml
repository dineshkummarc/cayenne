    	<subsection name="2.5.2 Clean Recompile">
    	<p>Cayenne 1.1 introduces a few API changes. Most of them are done to the backend and should not
    	affect the applications written with the earlier versions. However it is a good idea to perform a clean 
    	compilation of all Java code that relies on Cayenne. Updating calls to deprecated methods is a good idea 
    	as well.</p>
