        <u><strong><i>July 2003:</i></strong> <strong>New Website Design</strong></u></p>
        
        <p>Many thanks to our graphic artist Anna Drapeza who created this elegant site design!

        <u><strong><i>May 1 2003:</i></strong> <strong>National 
        Hockey League Switches to Cayenne</strong></u></p>
        
        <p>After the initial trial of Cayenne last October, NHL
        switched all their public applications running at <a href="http://www.nhl.com">NHL.com</a>
        to use Cayenne. With the help from <a href="http://objectstyle.com">ObjectStyle</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.centralparksoftware.com/">Central Park Software</a> the site was successfully
        launched to production. Currently applications receive more than 5 million hits a day.
