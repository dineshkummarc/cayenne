    <section name="Cayenne Examples">        
	<p>Cayenne examples should be <a href="../download.html">downloaded</a> separately from Cayenne. 
	Examples are normally not tested as thourougly as the core Cayenne code. They are provided mostly 
	for reference and learning purposes.
	</p>
	
	<panel name="Contributing Examples">
	Please contribute your own examples if you think they may be helpful to the new users or 
	demonstrate some unobvious use of Cayenne.
	</panel>
	
	<p>The following examples are currently available:</p>
	
	<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Example</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="aggregate-functions/index.html">SQL Aggregate Functions</a></td>
		<td>Demonstrates how to use "derived" DbEntities for SQL aggregate functions, such as
		MIN, MAX, COUNT.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><a href="data-port/index.html">DataPort</a></td>
		<td>Demonstrates how Cayenne can be used to port relational data from one 
			database to another. It shows the operation of the few internal parts of 
			Cayenne, normally not used in the applications. DataPort also contains a working 
			Ant task, so it has practical value for certain database maintenance tasks.

	<subsection name="Installing and Building Examples">
	<p>Most examples are distributed in a source form only, users must compile them
	using Ant buildfiles (build.xml) provided with each example. Generally the following
	steps are involved:</p>
	
	<p>Extract contents of cayenne-examples-[version].tar.gz into Cayenne installation directory
	(the location is important for the ant build files to find Cayenne):
	</p>
	<source># cd $CAYENNE_HOME
# gz -dc cayenne-examples-[version].tar.gz | tar xf -</source>

	<p>If an example contains <code>cayenne.xml</code> file, open it using CayenneModeler 
	(if such file exists), set appropriate connection information for the DataNodes, 
	and generate database schema.</p>

	<p>Build example with ant:
	</p>
	<source># cd $CAYENNE_HOME/cayenne-examples-[version]/[example-name]
# ant</source>
