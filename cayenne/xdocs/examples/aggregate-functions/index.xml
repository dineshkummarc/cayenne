    <section name="5. Aggregate Functions">
            
	<p>Demonstrates how to use "derived" DbEntities for SQL aggregate functions, such as
	MIN, MAX, COUNT. This example is runnable from command line.</p>

	<panel name="Deprecation Note">
		With introduction of SQLTemplate this example should be considered 
		deprecated, as derived DbEntities are very limited by nature.

	<subsection name="5.1 Building Example">
	<p>Follow generic instructions for building examples. <strong>(Important!)</strong> Before the 
	build, edit "default.properties" file, setting "driver.jar" property to the location of the
	JAR file of the JDBC driver.</p>
	
	</subsection>
	
	<subsection name="5.2 Running Example">
	<p>JAR file produced by the build script is runnable. E.g. the example can be executed like that:</p>
	
	<source># cd aggregate-functions/dist/lib/
# java -jar aggregate-functions.jar
	</source>
