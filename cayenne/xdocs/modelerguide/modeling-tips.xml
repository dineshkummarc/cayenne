        <section name="4. Modeling Tips">
        	<p>This section contains a few unorganized tips on Object/Relational modeling in Cayenne. 
        	Some of these tips may become obsolete in the future as the Modeler evolves, making
        	many things more transparent to the user.</p>
        	
        	<ul>
        		<li>Pay attention to validation messages when saving the project, this helps
        		preventing lots of runtime errors. Click on the error message to go to the
        		problem spot.</li>
        		
        		<li>All DbRelationships must have reverse relationships.</li>
        		
        		<li>TO-ONE ObjRelationships do not require reverse relationships to
        		work, but TO-MANY currently do.</li>
        		
        		<li>Do not map meaningless
        		primary key DbAttributes (like autogenerated sequential numbers) to ObjAttributes. 
        		Simply exclude them from the object model, Cayenne will do the right 
        		thing for you.</li>
        		
        		<li>Do not forget that even if you work with an existing database schema, 
        		special database objects may need to be created to support automated primary key
        		generation.
        		</li>
