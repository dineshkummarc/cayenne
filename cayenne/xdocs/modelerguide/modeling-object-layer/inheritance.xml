    	<subsection name="6.2 Modeling Inheritance">
		<p>"Inheritance" is an Object Oriented concept absent from traditional RDBMS world. 
		Still Cayenne allows to map a class hierarchy to the database schema. All classes
		in the hierarchy map to the same base table (this type of mapping is therefore called
		"single table inheritance"). One or more columns in the base table are usually assumed
		to be "class designator columns"; their values determine what object class to use when a fetched 
		row is converted to a persistent object.

    	<subsection name="6.2.1 Creating ObjEntity Hierarchy">
    	
    	<p>Consider the following class hierarchy that we want to map to a PERSON table: </p>
    	<img src="/images/modelerguide/inheritance-diagram.jpg" width="300" height="249"/>
    	
    	<p>For each of the four Java classes one may create individual ObjEntities, however only
    	AbstractPerson entity would map directly to the underlying "PERSON" DbEntity. For the 
    	rest instead of selecting a value from the "Table/View" dropdown, a corresponding
    	"super entity" from the "Inheritance" dropdown should be selected. Note that when an 
    	entity inherits from another entity, a list of inherited attributes and relationships
    	shows up as read only information under the corresponding tabs.</p>
    	</subsection>
    	
    	<subsection name="6.2.2 Defining Class Qualifier">
    	<p>Afer creating entity inheritance tree, it is important to configure
    	how the entities differ from each other, so that later when the data is fetched, Cayenne
    	would know which class to instantiate. This is achieved by using entity qualifiers described
    	earlier. Usually all entities in the hierarchy, except for the root, require such qualifier.
    	It should be created in such a way that it completely defines a given entity without considering any
    	subclasses or superclasses. In the example above, if the possible values of the class designator column
    	are  "EMPLOYEE", "MANAGER", "CUSTOMER", the following qualifiers might be used:
    	</p>
    	
    	<table>
    		<tr>
    			<th>ObjEntity</th>
    			<th>Qualifier</th>
    			<th>Qualifier Generated by Cayenne on SelectQuery</th>
    		</tr>
    		<tr>
    			<td>AbstractPersion</td>
    			<td>none</td>
    			<td>none</td>
    		</tr>
    		<tr>
    			<td>CustomerContact</td>
    			<td>personType = 'CUSTOMER'</td>
    			<td>personType = 'CUSTOMER'</td>
    		</tr>
			<tr>
    			<td>Employee</td>
    			<td>personType = 'EMPLOYEE'</td>
    			<td>personType = 'EMPLOYEE' or personType = 'MANAGER'</td>
    		</tr>
    		<tr>
    			<td>Manager</td>
    			<td>personType = 'MANAGER'</td>
    			<td>personType = 'MANAGER'</td>
    		</tr>
    	</table>
    	
    	<p> </p>
    	
    	<panel name="Qualifiers Note:">
    	It should be kept in mind when creating qualifiers, that when fetching
    	a non-leaf entity in the inheritance tree that itself has a qualifier, all qualifiers of its subclasses will be
    	joined with its qualifier using "or" as demonstrated in the table above for Employee entity. Also qualifiers
    	are not inherited.
