			<p>ClassPath Preferences panel allows users to map the locations of the external class libraries (JAR, ZIP, or class directories).
			These external libraries will be used by CayenneModeler to locate JDBC drivers, custom DB adapters, and other external classes needed
			for its operation. So if you see any CLASSPATH-related errors on DB reverse engineering, etc., in most cases you simply need to go to
			preferences ClassPath panel and create an entry pointing to a missing external library.
