			<p>CayenneModeler relies on a number of user-specific preferences to operate in a user-friendly
			manner. Some preferences are determined automatically behind the scenes (such as preferred 
			window size or last visited directory), some can be configured by users via "Preferences Panel" 
			described in this chapter.</p>

			<p>Preferences are saved and retrieved using Cayenne on top of embedded HSQL database. 
			The actual preferences data is stored as a set of SQL commands in a flat 
			file under <a href="../modeler-intro/cayenne-user-dir.html">Cayenne user directory</a>. 
			</p>

			<p>To display Preferences Panel, select <code>"Tools &gt; Preferences"</code> from the menu. 
			To navigate to a specific type of preferences, select an item from the list on the left. When "Save" button is
			clicked, preference selections are permanently stored in the preferences database and will not be lost 
			when the Modeler is restarted.</p>
