		<ol>
		<li>Do steps 1 through 6 of the previous section to create project and a domain.</li>
		<li>Click Tools->Reverse Engineer Database.
			System will bring up Enter JDBC Information dialog.</li>
		<li>Type in the connection information for the database and click
		Ok.
			In my case (I am connecting to the MySQL database).
			Make sure JDBC driver is in your Classpath or in jre\lib\ext.
			Also make sure you select RDBMS Adapter for your
			database.
			The adapter determines the generation of the SQL.</li>
		<li>If the database has multiple schemas,
			it will bring the Select schema dialog.
			Select the desired schema and click Ok.</li>
		<li>System may take several minutes to reverse engineer the database
		depending on its size.
			Once it is finished, it will add a new data map to the Domain.
			The new data map will have Db Entity generated per each DB table and
			Obj Entity generated per each Db Entity.
			If you database does not support foreign keys (like MySQL),
			no relationships will be generated.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		See previous section for more details on editing and saving the newly
		created model, as well as creating data nodes.
