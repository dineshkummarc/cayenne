 			<p><strong>Q.:</strong> After installation, an application using Cayenne
 			gives an error similar to 
 			<code>"ConfigException: [org.objectstyle.cayenne.conf.DefaultConfiguration] : 
 			Domain configuration file "cayenne.xml" is not found.", even though cayenne.xml
 			is in the CLASSPATH.</code></p>
 			
 			<p><strong>A.:</strong> Most likely this happened due to the fact that application 
 			classes and Cayenne classes are loaded by different ClassLoaders
 			and Cayenne configuration package can't access configuration
 			files accessible to application ClassLoader. Typical scenario
 			when this can happen is when cayenne.jar is placed in extensions
 			directory of the JVM ($JRE_HOME/lib/ext directory). In this case
 			programmer must explicitly bootstrap Cayenne to look for configuration
 			files in the right place. This can be done by the following code
 			(it can be added to "main" method of the applicaton for instance):	
 	     	</p>
 			
			<source>
// let Cayenne know about the default application ClassLoader
Configuration.bootstrapSharedConfig(MyClass.class);
</source>
