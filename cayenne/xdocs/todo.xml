        <p>Every volunteer project gets its strength from its participants.
        We invite everybody interested to participate in Cayenne.        
        If you are willing to help, this can be done in many different ways:
        <ul>
            <li>By contributing code.</li> 
            <li>By contributing documentation.</li> 
            <li>By testing Cayenne and reporting bugs.</li>
            <li>By using Cayenne and reporting bugs.</li>
            <li>By suggesting your own ideas on the mailing list and contributing
            code implementing them.</li>
        </ul>        
        </p>
        
        <p>If you want to become a contributor, first you should probably subscribe to 
        <a href="http://objectstyle.org/cayenne/lists.html">Cayenne Developer Mailing List.</a>
        to see what issues are discussed and to communicate with the project team.
        Normally code and documentation contributions are made via patches sent
        to developer list. If your contributions are significant and you are willing 
        to join the core team, current committers can vote to give you CVS write access 
        and other committer rights.
        A good discussion on how to create and submit code patches is located at 
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/source.html">Jakarta Apache</a> site.
        You can use all these hints as related to Cayenne.
