        <p>Every volunteer project gets its strength from its participants.
        We invite everybody to participate in Cayenne in any way that is suitable for you.
        
        If you are willing to help, you can do it in many different ways:
        <ul>
            <li>By contributing code for one or more tasks listsed below</li> 
            <li>By contributing documentation</li> 
            <li>By testing Cayenne and reporting bugs</li>
            <li>By using Cayenne and reporting bugs</li>
            <li>By suggesting your own ideas on the mailing list</li>
        </ul>        
        </p>
        
        <p>If you want to become a contributor, first you should probably subscribe to 
        <a href="http://objectstyle.org/developer/mailinglists.html">Cayenne Developer Mailing List.</a>
        to see what issues are discussed and to communicate with the project team.</p>
        
        <p>Normally code and documentation contributions are made via patches sent
        to developer list. 
        A good discussion on how to create and submit code patches is located at 
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/source.html">Jakarta Apache</a> site.
        You can use all these hints as related to Cayenne.
