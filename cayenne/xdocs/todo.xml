        <section name="How Can I Help">
        <p>Every volunteer project gets its strength from its participants.
        We invite everybody interested to participate in Cayenne.        
        If you are willing to help, this can be done in many different ways:
        <ul>
            <li>By contributing code.</li> 
            <li>By contributing documentation.</li> 
            <li>By testing Cayenne and reporting bugs.</li>
            <li>By using Cayenne and reporting bugs.</li>
            <li>By suggesting your own ideas on the mailing list and contributing
            code implementing them.</li>
        </ul>        
        </p>
        
        <p>If you want to become a contributor, first you should probably subscribe to 
        <a href="http://objectstyle.org/cayenne/lists.html">Cayenne Developer Mailing List.</a>
        to see what issues are discussed and to communicate with the project team.
        Normally code and documentation contributions are made via patches sent
        to developer list. If your contributions are significant and you are willing 
        to join the core team, current committers can vote to give you CVS write access 
        and other committer rights.</p>
        
        <subsection name="How to Create a Patch">
        <p>Preferred way to create a patch is to check out Cayenne source tree from CVS,
        make changes to the local copy, and then run the following command (GUI CVS clients
        usually have support for this feature as well):
        </p>
<source>
cd cayenne
cvs diff -u > patch.txt
</source>

		<p>Resulting <code>patch.txt</code> file will contain changes to all Cayenne files
		as compared to the latest CVS version.</p>
