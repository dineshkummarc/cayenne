      	<p>Cayenne utilizes an advanced issue tracker that maintains a database of bugs, feature requests and improvements,
      	allowing collaborative project management and more. It is based on JIRA software from atlassian.com. Below is 
      	quick links to the important sections of the issue tracker:
		</p>
		
      	<ul>
      		<li><a href="http://objectstyle.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa">Submit New Bug</a></li>
      		<li><a href="http://objectstyle.org/jira/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10000">Browse All Bugs</a></li>
      		<li><a href="http://objectstyle.org/jira/secure/Signup!default.jspa">Register to Submit and Track Bugs</a></li>
      	</ul>
     	
            	
		
		<panel name="Note:">
		Anybody is allowed to browse the database of Cayenne issues without logging in. But in order to submit, track, 
		and vote on bugs a user must register with our JIRA system. Please use the "Register.." link above to create an
