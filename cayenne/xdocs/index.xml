        <p><u><strong><i>September 8, 2003:</i></strong> <strong>Cayenne-Examples 1.0b1 is Released</strong></u></p>
        
        <p>Initial release of cayenne-examples is available for download
        from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=48132">SourceForge</a>.
        It includes a demo tool called DataPort, demonstrating how Cayenne can be used 
        to port relational data from one database to another. It shows the operation of the few 
        internal parts of Cayenne, normally not used in the applications. DataPort also contains 
        a working Ant task, so it has practical value for some database maintenance tasks. 
        Documentation for cayenne-examples is bundled with the distribution and is not available 
        from this site.

        <u><strong><i>July 2003:</i></strong> <strong>New Website Design</strong></u></p>
        
        <p>Many thanks to our graphic artist Anna Drapeza who created this elegant site design!
        Sadly enough good artistic work is still a rare thing in the OpenSource world.

        <u><strong><i>May 1 2003:</i></strong> <strong>National 
        Hockey League Switches to Cayenne</strong></u></p>
        
        <p>After the initial trial of Cayenne last October, NHL
        switched all their public applications running at <a href="http://www.nhl.com">NHL.com</a>
        to use Cayenne. With the help from <a href="http://objectstyle.com">ObjectStyle</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.centralparksoftware.com/">Central Park Software</a> the site was successfully
        launched to production. Currently applications receive more than 5 million hits a day.

        <!-- About section -->
        <section name="About Cayenne">
        <p>Cayenne is a powerful, full-featured OpenSource Object/Relational framework. 
        Cayenne is written in Java and is intended for Java developers working with
        relational databases. Cayenne has been successfully deployed in production environment on high 
        volume sites. Cayenne has a growing international user and developer community.</p>
        
        <p>Cayenne provides management of persistent Java objects mapped to relational databases, 
        single method call queries and updates (including atomic updates of all modified objects), 
        seamless integration of multiple databases into a single virtual data source. 
        Cayenne is distributed with CayenneModeler -
        a complete GUI mapping tool that supports reverse-engineering of RDBMS schema, 
        working with database mappings and generation of Java source code for the 
        persistent objects.</p>
        
        <p>Cayenne is an OpenSource project and as such encourages the 
        community to participate in development, testing and writing documentation.
        This way we can produce a better product that will benefit both contributors
        and user community.</p>
