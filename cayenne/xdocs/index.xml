        <p><i>March 16:</i> <strong>Cayenne at SourceForge and Freshmeat.</strong> 
        Cayenne is still hosted

        Bug tracking, CVS and downloads 
        will be performed from SourceForge. Also Cayenne is registered at

        <!-- Welcome section -->
        <section name="Welcome to Cayenne">
        <p>Welcome to Cayenne. Our goal is to provide Java developers with opensource 
        tools to access relational databases in an object-oriented way.</p>
        
        <p>Cayenne includes a framework that adds persistence features to Java objects.
        It allows mapping classes to database tables. Queries and updates (including 
        atomic updates of all modified objects) are done with a single method call. 
        This is a big advantage over writing SQL code in your Java program.
        Cayenne also provides GUI mapping tool (called CayenneModeler) to reverse-engineer 
        RDBMS schema and create "data maps" - XML files that contain mapping 
        between the database and Java classes. CayenneModeler can also generate 
        Java classes source code to use in your Java application.</p>
        
        
        <p>Cayenne is an opensource project and therefore encourages developer and user 
        community to participate in development, testing and writing documentation.
        This way we can produce a better product that will benefit its contributors
        as well as everybody else.</p>

        <!-- Status section -->
        <section name="Status and History">
        <p>Idea of Cayenne was conceived back in April 2001 by a group of developers in 
        Atlanta, USA. Current version is based on that original idea and is under active 
        development since December 2001. Current Cayenne version is 1.0a1 (alpha).
        It can be downloaded from <a href="download.html">here</a>.</p>
