        <p><u><strong><i>July 29:</i></strong> <strong>Cayenne 
        Comparison Chart.</strong></u></p>
        
        <p>Having received multiple requests to compare Cayenne features
        with other O/R frameworks we decided to leverage the community collective knowledge
        to do this research. A WikiWiki page was setup to build a feature matrix at
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?CayenneVsOther">http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?CayenneVsOther</a>.
        Anybody who has experience with TopLink, CocoBase, EOF, etc. are welcome to provide
        the input interactively via WikiWiki collaboration engine. To participate, click on the link
        above, scroll to the bottom of the page and select "Edit Text".

        <section name="Welcome to Cayenne">
        <p>Welcome to Cayenne. Our goal is to provide Java developers with opensource 
        tools to access relational databases in an object-oriented way.</p>
        
        <p>Cayenne includes a framework that adds persistence features to Java objects.
        It allows mapping classes to database tables. Queries and updates (including 
        atomic updates of all modified objects) are done with a single method call. 
        This is a big advantage over writing SQL code in your Java program.
        Cayenne also provides GUI mapping tool (called CayenneModeler) to reverse-engineer 
        RDBMS schema and create "data maps" - XML files that contain mapping 
        between the database and Java classes. CayenneModeler can also generate 
        Java classes source code to use in your Java application.</p>
        
        
        <p>Cayenne is an opensource project and therefore encourages developer and user 
        community to participate in development, testing and writing documentation.
        This way we can produce a better product that will benefit its contributors
        as well as everybody else.</p>

        <section name="History">
        <p>Idea of Cayenne was conceived back in April 2001 by a group of developers in 
        Atlanta, USA. Current version is based on that original idea and is under active 
        development since December 2001. Right now Cayenne has a growing international
        user and developer community.</p>
