        <section name="About Cayenne">
        <p>Cayenne is a powerful, full-featured OpenSource Object/Relational framework. 
        Cayenne is written in Java and is intended for Java developers working with
        relational databases. Cayenne has been successfully deployed in production environment on high 
        volume sites. Cayenne has a growing international user and developer community.</p>
        
        <p>Cayenne provides management of persistent Java objects mapped to relational databases, 
        single method call queries and updates (including atomic updates of all modified objects), 
        seamless integration of multiple databases into a single virtual data source. 
        Cayenne is distributed with CayenneModeler -
        a complete GUI mapping tool that supports reverse-engineering of RDBMS schema, 
        working with database mappings and generation of Java source code for the 
        persistent objects.</p>
        
        <p>Cayenne is an OpenSource project and as such encourages the 
        community to participate in development, testing and writing documentation.
        This way we can produce a better product that will benefit both contributors
        and user community.</p>
