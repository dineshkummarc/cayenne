        <section name="About Cayenne">
        <p>Cayenne is a high-quality OpenSource Object/Relational framework. 
        Cayenne is written in Java and is intended for Java developers working with
        relational databases. Though its current release status is Alpha, Cayenne
        has been already successfully deployed in production environment on high 
        volume sites.</p>
        
        <p>Among Cayenne features are management of persistent Java objects
        using mapping to relational database, single method call queries and updates 
        (including atomic updates of all modified objects), seamless integration
        of multiple databases into a single virtual data source. 
        Cayenne is distributed with CayenneModeler -
        a complete GUI mapping tool to reverse-engineer RDBMS schema and to work with database
        mappings. CayenneModeler also supports generation of Java source code for the 
        persistent objects.</p>
        
        <p>Cayenne is an OpenSource project and as such encourages the 
        community to participate in development, testing and writing documentation.
        This way we can produce a better product that will benefit its contributors
        as well as everybody else.</p>

        <section name="History">
        <p>Idea of Cayenne was conceived back in April 2001 by a group of developers in 
        Atlanta, USA. Current version is based on that original idea and is under active 
        development since December 2001. Right now Cayenne has a growing international
        user and developer community.</p>
