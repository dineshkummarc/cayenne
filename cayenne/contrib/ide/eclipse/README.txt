Sample eclipse IDE (http://eclipse.org) Cayenne project files.

To setup Cayenne as an eclipse project, check out the code, and copy the two
files in this directory (.classpath and .project) into the root "cayenne"
directory, then import the project into eclipse.

If you have used eclipse to check out the tree, after copying the files
you will need to restart in order to have the project recognized as
'Java project'.

For further help send mail to cayenne-devel@objectstyle.org!
