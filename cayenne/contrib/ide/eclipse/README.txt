Sample eclipse IDE (http://eclipse.org) Cayenne project files.

To setup Cayenne as an eclipse project, check out the code, and copy the two
files in this directory (.classpath and .project) into the root "cayenne"
directory, then import the project into eclipse.

If you have used eclipse to check out the tree (much easier!) you can use
the Resource Navigator to copy the files. Either use copy/paste via the
context menu or drag-and-CTRL-drop them to the root of the directory.

If you have copied the files from outside eclipse (Windows explorer,
command line..) you will need to restart in order to have the project
recognized as 'Java project'.
