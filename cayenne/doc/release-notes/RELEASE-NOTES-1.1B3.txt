Changes, Features And Improvements:

- Added "File -> Revert" menu to the modeler.
- Changed behavior of DbGenerator to stop guessing what tables should be dropped/created. Instead now
  it runs all generated SQL statements, and catches any problems. This is more reliable, as old 
  behavior didn't work well when a user had default access to multiple schemas (e.g. a DBA user on Oracle).
