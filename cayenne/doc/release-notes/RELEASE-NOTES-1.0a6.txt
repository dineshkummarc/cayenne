Changes/Additions in this release:
============================================
1. Delete rules now able to be specified on ObjRelationships, to automatically
cascade along a relationship, nullify the inverse, or completely deny the deletion 
based on the status of the related objects.

2. Modeler startup scripts are updated to guess CAYENNE_HOME based on the standard
distribution structure, if it is not set explicitly.

3. Cayenne AND/OR expressions are converted to a new expression class - ListExpressions. 
As a result, generated SQL contains fewer unneeded parenthesis and is generally cleaner.

4. Added parameterized expressions - expressions that can be used as prototypes for other 
application expressions.

5. Added parameterized queries based on parameterized expressions.

6. DomainHelper is deprecated and refactored into 2 classes - 
ConfigLoader and ConfigSaver. Implementation is changed to use external delegates
to process loaded XML. This allows alternative loaders.

7. Named queries can now be associated with Entities. This is a good way to cache shared 
query definitions.

8. "IN" expressions can now take both java.util.List and Object[] 
operands.

9. Moved DataMap sorting code to DataMap from OperationSorter, 
deprecating the appropriate method.

10. Initial implementation of an event-based notification mechanism

11. Added cdeploy - Ant task for cayenne deployment configuration.

12. Added consistent "simplified" expression API.

13. Added extensive expressions documentation (see user guide).

14. Fixed schema handling in the DDL operations.

15. Fixed NULL handling in qualifiers.
