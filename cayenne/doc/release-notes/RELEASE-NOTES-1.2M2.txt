Changes:

- Removed almost all classes and methods deprecated in 1.1.
- Changed ObjectId.replacementId API. If your code relies on replacementId 
  (e.g. if you create custom ObjectIds), it is strongly advised that you switch 
  to the new API (which It is actually simpler....)
- Upgraded JDOM library to v. 1.0
- Removed system CLASSPATH from Modeler startup scripts.
- Thread-local static ClassLoader in Configuration.
- Persistence by reachability (CAY-249, part 1)
- Updated Expression BNF, replacing "scalarCharExpression" with "scalarExpression"
- Unconditionally applying entity sorting on commit, even if DB does not support constraints.
- Renamed BasicServletConfiguration to ServetConfiguration (old name didn't make much sense and was 
  used for legacy reasons)... Added ServetConfiguration.addContextPath() method to specify custom locations
  via API in addition to "cayenne.configuration.path" property.

Bugs Fixed:

CAY-251 NPE on calling stored proc for SQL Server.
