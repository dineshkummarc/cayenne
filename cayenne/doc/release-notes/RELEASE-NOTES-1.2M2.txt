Changes:

- Removed almost all classes and methods deprecated in 1.1.
- Changed ObjectId.replacementId API. If your code relies on replacementId 
  (e.g. if you create custom ObjectIds), it is strongly advised that you switch 
  to the new API (which It is actually simpler....)
- Upgraded JDOM library to v. 1.0
- Removed system CLASSPATH from Modeler startup scripts.
- Thread-local static ClassLoader in Configuration.
- Persistence by reachability (CAY-249, part 1)
- Updated Expression BNF, replacing "scalarCharExpression" with "scalarExpression"
- Unconditionally applying entity sorting on commit, even if DB does not support constraints.
- BasicServletConfiguration is deprecated as it is redundant. Superclass has all the functionality needed.
  All its static methods are extracted into ServetUtil
- Expanded deployment chapter of the user guide with extrav options 
  (some existed before but were not documented).

Bugs Fixed:

CAY-251 NPE on calling stored proc for SQL Server.
