Notes: 

- bug id's refer to SourceForge bug tracking system at 
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=48132&atid=452068 

- only issues that affect the ability to use Cayenne are listed.
  Things like general interface improvement requests are not shown.
============================================

1. Incomplete documentation .
   Some chapters of the UserGuide are just placeholders and still need to 
   be written. Some require more work. CayenneModeler chapter needs screenshots.

   Workaround: use Cayenne mailing lists http://objectstyle.org/cayenne/lists.html 
   for any specific questions.

---------------------------------------------

2. Bug ID 549101. When data node and data map file locations are 
   changed, old file are not removed.
   
   Workaround: Remove old files manually or ignore them.
---------------------------------------------

3. PostgreSQL support. Even though Cayenne libraries contain 
   PostgresAdapter, it has not been implemented or tested. PostgreSQL
   support is postponed till later releases.   
---------------------------------------------

4. Bug ID 563131. Connection leak in CayenneModeler during database
   reverse engineering.
   
   Workaround: This is a bug reported based on the code review. It never
   caused any problems during testing. If it does, close CayenneModeler,
   then reopen it.
