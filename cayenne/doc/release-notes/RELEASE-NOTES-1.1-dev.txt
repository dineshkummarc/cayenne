            Cayenne Release Notes 1.1 
                 Date: [unreleased]
         ============================================

Changes Since 1.0:

1. QueryEngine.performQuery(Query, OperationObserver) is deprecated
as redundant.

2. ContextSelectObserver is deprecated. Its functionality is now implemented in 
the superclass.

3. SnapshotManager is now stateless and is used as a singelton.

4. Fixed CayenneDataObject.readNestedProperty() to avoid converting all
non-persistent properties to String. [Bug 817449]

5. FlattenedObjectId is no longer used for tracking to-one flattened relationships
(or for anything else for that matter). Instead a correct solution
using RelationshipFault is implemented. [Bug 813413]
