Changes/New Features:

* ObjectContext API:
  - ObjectContext graph events.
  - OPPChannel graph events (including remote)
  - commit/rollback renamed to look like DataContext ones - commitChanges/rollbackChanges
  - new revertChanges and flushChanges methods.
  - Runtime-customizable ClassDescriptors.
  
* Multi Tier API:
  - support for shared sessions (peer ObjectContexts controlled by different users share the same parent)

* Auto-sorted relationship list - org.objectstyle.cayenne.util.IndexPropertyList. 
  Supported for ObjectContext only for now, but should be easy to extend to DataContext.
* Cayenne stack events are no longer sent via a shared "default" EventManager. Instead
  an EventManager instance is assigned to Configuration.
* EventBridge supports multiple local EventSubjects.
* Listener methods registered with EventManager no longer have to be public. Any non-public methods 
  and non-public classes will work. This is nice for implementing listener methods without exposing 
  them in the API (or using inner classes that didn't work before).
