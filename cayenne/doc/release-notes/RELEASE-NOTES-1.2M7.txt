Changes/New Features:

* ObjectContext graph events.
* OPPChannel graph events.
* ObjectContext commit/rollback renamed to look like DataContext ones - commitChanges/rollbackChanges.
* Runtime-customizable ClassDescriptors.
* Auto-sorted relationship list - org.objectstyle.cayenne.util.IndexPropertyList. 
  Supported for ObjectContext only for now, but should be easy to extend to DataContext.
* Cayenne stack events are no longer sent via a shared "default" EventManager. Instead
  an EventManager instance is assigned to Configuration.
* Listener methods registered with EventManager no longer have to be public. Any non-public methods 
  and non-public classes will work. This is nice for implementing listener methods without exposing 
  them in the API (or using inner classes that didn't work before).
