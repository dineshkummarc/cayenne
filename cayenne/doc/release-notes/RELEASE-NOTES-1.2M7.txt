Changes/New Features:

* ObjectContext API:
  - ObjectContext graph events.
  - OPPChannel graph events (including remote)
  - commit/rollback renamed to look like DataContext ones - commitChanges/rollbackChanges
  - new revertChanges and flushChanges methods.
  - Runtime-customizable ClassDescriptors.
  
* Multi Tier API:
  - support for shared sessions (peer ObjectContexts controlled by different users share the same parent)
  - OPPConnector was renamed to OPPConnection (all implementors were renamed accordingly).
  - web.xml configuration is simplified (see HessianService Javadocs for details). 
    WARINING: You must update your web.xml if you used HessianService with M6, check UPGRADE-NOTES for details.

* Support for mapping int or character DB columns as JDK 1.5 Enums is now built in to Cayenne. No need 
  to register special ExtendedTypes for your custom enums.
* JDOM is no longer needed for XML (de)serialization - everything is done using JAXP classes 
  bundled with JDK.
* No longer storing or relying on ClassLoader stored in Configuration. 
  Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() is what Cayenne now uses internally.
* Auto-sorted relationship list - org.objectstyle.cayenne.util.IndexPropertyList. 
  Supported for ObjectContext only for now, but should be easy to extend to DataContext.
* Cayenne stack events are no longer sent via a shared "default" EventManager. Instead
  an EventManager instance is assigned to Configuration.
* EventBridge supports multiple local EventSubjects.
* Listener methods registered with EventManager no longer have to be public. Any non-public methods 
  and non-public classes will work. This is nice for implementing listener methods without exposing 
  them in the API (or using inner classes that didn't work before).
  

  Bugs Fixed:
  
  * Cayenne no longer includes Oracle "recycle bin" tables in reverse-engineering results (those are the 
    tables with names like "BIN$04LhcpndanfgMAAAAAANPw==$0" that are "recycled" dropped tables.
