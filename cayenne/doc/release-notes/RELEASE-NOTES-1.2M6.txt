Changes/New Features:

* Added support for ObjectIds in qualifier expressions
* Changed AUTO_PK_TABLE default definition to include primary key constraint (somewhat related to CAY-245)
* org.objectstyle.cayenne.map.MapObject is deprecated and removed from map package classes 
  inheritance hierarchy. If you cast Cayenne mapping objects to MapObject, change the cast to CayenneMapEntry
* A contract between Expression and Transformer in Expression.transform(..) is altered. Now Transformer must return 
  Expression.PRUNED_NODE to indicate that a node subtree has to go. 
* Fixed query ordering and prefetch panels ugliness.

* Multi Tier Progress:
 - relationships are done
 - commit/rollback work
 - added support for HTTP basic authentication to HessianConnector
 - arbitrary queries are available on the client (watch out - security becomes essential !!). 
 - the following queries should work on the client: NamedQuery, RelationshipQuery, QueryChain, SelectQuery, SQLTemplate.
