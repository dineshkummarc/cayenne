Changes/New Features:

* Cayenne HEAD branch (i.e. 1.2) will no longer maintain JDK 1.3 comptibility. If JDK upgrade is not an option
  for you (e.g. you are on WebSphere 5.0), consider sticking with Cayenne 1.1 for the time being.
* Cayenne no longer requires Jakarta BeanUtils. 
* Added support for ObjectIds in qualifier expressions
* Changed AUTO_PK_TABLE default definition to include primary key constraint (somewhat related to CAY-245)
* org.objectstyle.cayenne.map.MapObject is deprecated and removed from map package classes 
  inheritance hierarchy. If you cast Cayenne mapping objects to MapObject, change the cast to CayenneMapEntry
* A contract between Expression and Transformer in Expression.transform(..) is altered. Now Transformer must return 
  Expression.PRUNED_NODE to indicate that a node subtree has to be removed. 
* Fixed UI bugs in query ordering and prefetch panels.
* Deprecated explicit log levels in Query, OperantionHints and DataContext.
* DataContext can be subclassed via DataContextFactory.
* TempObjectId is deprecated. Superclass is used instead. See TempObjectId javadocs for migration hints.
* PostgreSQLAdapter's default "BLOB" mapping is changed from "bytea" to "oid". See UPGRADE notes for details.

* Multi Tier Progress:
 - relationships are done
 - commit/rollback work
 - added support for HTTP basic authentication to HessianConnector
 - arbitrary queries are available on the client (watch out - security becomes essential !!). 
 - the following queries should work on the client: NamedQuery, RelationshipQuery, QueryChain, SelectQuery, SQLTemplate.
