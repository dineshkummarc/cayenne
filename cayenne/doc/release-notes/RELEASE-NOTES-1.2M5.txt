Changes/New Features:

* SQLTemplateExecutionPlan and SQLTemplateSelectExecutionPlan classes are removed from 
  Cayenne. Keeping it in deprecated state is no longer possible due to SQLAction method 
  signature changes.
* A change in the order of loading resources via ResourceLocator (this includes cayenne.xml loading). 
  Now custom classpath locations take precedence over the default one.
* Changing default MySQL mapping of JDBC TIMESTAMP to be "DATETIME". This is a more sensible default as TIMESTAMP
  is autoinitialized by MySQL on insert.
