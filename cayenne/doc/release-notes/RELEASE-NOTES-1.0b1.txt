Changes in this release:
============================================
0. JDK 1.3 compatibility is implemented.

1. Added shortcut methods to Expression and ExpressionFactory
to make API friendlier.

2. Added convenience constructors to ObjectId

3. Added file logging to CayenneModeler

4. Implemented (limited) in-memory expression evaluation
and array filtering

5. Added "fetch limit" to select queries.

6. Added DerivedDbEntity with GROUP BY support

7. Added DerivedDbAttribute with aggregate function support.

8. Simplified MapLoader API, got rid of interface-implementation 
pair.

9. Added support for relationships accross DataMaps, 
and other cross-map communications, both in the core and in the 
modeler.

10. "Query" is now an interface to allow more flexibility
for subclassing of queries. Its default implementation is 
AbstractQuery.

11. Removed GuiFacade from map package, instead created MapUtil
in gui.util.

12. DataMap XML format changes for derived entities
and attributes (see data-map.dtd). Note: older data maps
are 100% compatible with the new format

13. Implemented "failsafe" saving process in CayenneModeler.
Now all files are first saved to the temporary file, and only
on successful save, temp files will replace the master files.

14. Fixed CayenneException and CayenneRuntimeException to report
exception cause properly.

15. Ordering now supports DB_NAME expressions. As a result,
setSortPathSpec and getSortPathSpec are deprecated.

16. Added "read-only" object entities

17. Switched to Log4J to be JDK 1.3 compatible. All Java logging 
public API is deprecated.

18. Switched to Jakarta ORO from Java regex to be JDK 1.3 compatible. 

19. ToManyList no longer uses WeakReference to hold relationship data,
since it breaks when relationships are modified.
