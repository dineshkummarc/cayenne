Changes in this release:
============================================
1. Delete rules now able to be specified on ObjRelationships, to automatically
cascade along a relationship, nullify the inverse, or completely deny the deletion 
based on the status of the related objects.

2. Modeler stratup scripts are updated to guess CAYENNE_HOME based on the standard
distribution structure, if it is not set explicitly.
