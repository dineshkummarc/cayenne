Changes in this release:
============================================
1. Delete rules now able to be specified on ObjRelationships, to automatically
cascade along a relationship, nullify the inverse, or completely deny the deletion 
based on the status of the related objects.

2. Modeler startup scripts are updated to guess CAYENNE_HOME based on the standard
distribution structure, if it is not set explicitly.

3. Cayenne AND/OR expressions are converted to a new expression class - ListExpressions. 
As a result, generated SQL contains fewer unneeded parenthesis and is generally cleaner.

4. Added parametrized expressions - expressions that can be used as prototypes for other 
application expressions.

5. Added parametrized queries based on parametrized expressions.
