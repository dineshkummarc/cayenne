           Cayenne Release Notes 1.0b1 (Beta 1)
                 Date: [unreleased]
         ============================================

For the latest information go to the project web site at

Changes in this release:
============================================
1. Created a project package to handle project file operations 
independently from GUI, switched CayenneModeler to this package.
This allowed to eliminate explicit "location" selection and fixed
lots of bugs.

2. Project structure update - now linked files have
preset extensions, and project file version is saved in "cayenne.xml".
Old format is still understood by Cayenne runtime. 

3. GUI would allow to upgrade from the earlier projects.

4. DataNode.DEFAULT_ADAPTER_CLASS is now an instance of Class, not String

5. Introduced a concept of queries by Class as opposed to symbolic 
entity names. A few items below are related to this change.

6. Created a new class EntityResolver to quickly map the queries
to appropriate entities.

7. Deprecated QueryEngine.lookupEntity in favor of 
QueryEngine.getEntityResolver().lookup...()
