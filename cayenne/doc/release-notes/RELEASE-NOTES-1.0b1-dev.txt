                 Date: [unreleased]

Changes in this release:
============================================
1. Delete rules now able to be specified on ObjRelationships, to automatically
cascade along a relationship, nullify the inverse, or completely deny the deletion 
based on the status of the related objects.

2. Modeler startup scripts are updated to guess CAYENNE_HOME based on the standard
distribution structure, if it is not set explicitly.

3. Cayenne AND/OR expressions are converted to a new expression class - ListExpressions. 
As a result, generated SQL contains fewer unneeded parenthesis and is generally cleaner.

4. Added parameterized expressions - expressions that can be used as prototypes for other 
application expressions.

5. Added parameterized queries based on parameterized expressions.

6. DomainHelper is deprecated and refactored into 2 classes - 
ConfigLoader and ConfigSaver. Implementation is changed to use external delegates
to process loaded XML. This allows alternative loaders.

7. Named queries can now be associated with Entities. This is a good way to cache shared 
query definitions.

8. "IN" expressions can now take both java.util.List and Object[] 
operands.
