Cayenne Release Notes 1.0 (Final)
                 Date: [unreleased]
         ============================================

Changes in this release:

1. Added the ability to "shutdown" Cayenne, closing all database connections. This only
works if internal Cayenne connection pool is used.

2. Changed arbitrary queue size in connection pool to unlimited.

3. {Modeler}: Added preselection of database connection info on "reengineer database"
when a DataNode is selected.

4. {Modeler}: Added support for customizable sequences on Oracle.

5. Fixed bugs in EOModelProcessor that prevented incomplete (or argueably inconsistent) 
EOModels from loading. Right now Cayenne will try to fix or ignore questionable 
objects during import.

6. {Modeler}: Changed the way DataMaps are linked to DataNodes from being hidden deep in the menus
to be displayed on the DataMap panel instead.

7. {Modeler}: Fixed visual inconsistencies happenning on delete of rows in tables, 
such as Attributes and relationships. Bugs 707926, 664516.

8. Configuration will detect an existing Log4j setup and use it instead of trying
to reconfigure itself.
