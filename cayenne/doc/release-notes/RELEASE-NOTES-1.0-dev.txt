2. Removed classes and methods, deprecated in Beta 1, as announced. 
   
IMPORTANT: as a result of removing deprecated methods, Velocity templates used for 
class generation where updated. If you are using custom templates, make sure you 
update them accordingly (e.g. replace all calls to classGen.Entity.AttributeList to
classGen.Entity.Attributes and classGen.Entity.RelationshipList to classGen.Entity.Relationships)

3. Fixed a problem with CHAR primary key columns on Oracle. Earlier updates
and deletes were failing. Bug report 730396:
