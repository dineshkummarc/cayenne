This is a project structure for cayenne project tree. Ant build files (build.xml) 
would support this structure.


Developer machine view (if developers have IDE-specific files, they should not be checked in to CVS):
 
   -- cayenne/		
      -- bin/				# common binaries, scripts - put this in the path
      					# NOT IN CVS! Distribution directory only.
      -- lib/				# Cayenne istribution library
      					# NOT IN CVS! Distribution directory only.
      -- otherlib/			# 3-rd party Java libraries go in to this directory
      -- doc/				# Documentation 
      -- src/				# main source tree
         -- build.xml	    # main project build file...   
         -- build/		    # NOT IN CVS! Temporary build directory.
         -- org/
            -- objectstyle/
               -- cayenne/
                  -- other_packages/ 
      -- tests/				# unit tests source tree
          -- build.xml		# tests subproject build file...   
          -- org/
             -- objectstyle/
                -- cayenne/
                   -- other_packages/ 
      -- build.xml			# master build file...   
     
     
Notes:

Another way of looking at this structure is that "src" is a main project source, 
"tests" is a subproject. The same format can be used to create other subprojects 
as well.
