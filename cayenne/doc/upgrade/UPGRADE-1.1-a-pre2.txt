Upgrade Information
============================================

Cayenne 1.1 adds new elements to the XML format of its project files, 
making them incompatible with the older versions of Cayenne. However 
older files can still be deployed with 1.1, so it is backwards compatible. 
To upgrade an old project, open it in CayenneModeler and click the 
"Upgrade" button when the "Upgrade" Dialog appears.

For the latest upgrade instructions see the Use Guide provided with Cayenne
