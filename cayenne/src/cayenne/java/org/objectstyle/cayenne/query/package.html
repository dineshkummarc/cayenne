Defines a number of standard queries supported by Cayenne. Most of these queries are used by Cayenne internally. 
In most cases Cayenne users would only care about these three query classes: SelectQuery, SQLTemplate and ProcedureQuery. 

<p>A custom Query and GenericSelectQuery implementations can be used to extend and/or customize standard query set.
To make such query runnable with Cayenne, users must provide a meaningful implementation of Query.toSQLAction() method. 
Such implemmentation would normally either create a query from a standard Cayenne set, and delegate the execution to it
(acting as a sort of "query builder"),
or can implement its own non-standard SQLAction.</p>
