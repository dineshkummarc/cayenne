		<subsection name="2.5.1 General Upgrade Recommendations">
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Upgrade XML files.</strong> Open your project with the version of 
				the Modeler that came with the latest download. If an upgrade dialog 
				pops up, select "yes" to do an upgrade. Also if you are using a 
				milestone or a nightly build it is also a good idea to make some 
				insignificant change to the model (so that a "Save" button is 
				activated) and do a save. </li>
			<li><strong>Do a clean recomplie.</strong> Recompile all your code, to make sure 
				that you are not using any old classes or methods. Pay 
				attention to deprecation warnings. It is always a good idea to 
				update your code to avoid deprecated API.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> </p>			
			<panel name="Warning!">Upgrading project XML files will likely make them 
				unusable with earlier versions of Cayenne.</panel>

    	<subsection name="2.5.2 Upgrading from 1.1 and 1.0">

		<ul>
			<li><strong>PostgreSQL PK Generator</strong> [For PostgreSQL users 
				only] Since Cayenne 1.2 default PK generator for PostgreSQL 
				database uses database sequences instead of AUTO_PK_TABLE. To 
				port an existing application, you will need to create those 
				sequences and assign correct current values to them (e.g. taken 
				from the old AUTO_PK_TABLE). After that AUTO_PK_TABLE can be 
				dropped.</li>
