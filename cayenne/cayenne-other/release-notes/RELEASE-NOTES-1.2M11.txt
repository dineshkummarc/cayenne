Changes/New Features:

* Addressing concurrency issues in Derby PK generator.

* Speeding up very slow Modeler attribute and relationship operations.

* Completely changed the signatures of OPPChannel interface, as using messaging-based
  API patterns made no sens in the local application context. Note that this does NOT 
  affect 99.99% of the users.

* DataContextDelegate changes: "willPerformSelect" method is deprecated, instead two methods
  added: "willPerformQuery" (for selecting queries) and "willPerformGenericQuery" 
  (for all other queries).
  
* Implementation of QueryEngine by DataContext is deprecated. But now DataContext implements OPPChannel
  and ObjectContext interfaces instead.
  
* Removed 'performNonSelectingQuery' method from ObjectContext and CayenneContext. It is redundant. 
  Use 'performGenericQuery(query).getFirstUpdateCounts(query)' instead.
