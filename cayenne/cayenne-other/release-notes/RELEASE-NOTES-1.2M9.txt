Changes/New Features:

* Generated/Identity Columns
  - Derby support for generated columns
  - Modeler now allows to specify generated columns for PK only. Non-pk column can't be generated.

* Oracle DATE type is now reverse engineered by default as JDBC TIMESTAMP, as it can store both 
  date and time info.
