Changes/New Features:

* Generated/Identity Columns - http://objectstyle.org/confluence/display/CAY/Generated+Columns
  - Derby support for generated columns
  - Modeler now allows to specify generated columns for PK only. Non-pk column can't be generated:

* Oracle DATE type is now reverse engineered by default as JDBC TIMESTAMP, as it can store both 
  date and time info.
  
* DbRelationship.srcFkSnapshotWithTargetSnapshot(..) and DbRelationship.srcPkSnapshotWithTargetSnapshot
  no longer throw an exception when null values are found in primary key snapshot, recognizing that key
  generation may be deferred (case of DB-generated keys).
