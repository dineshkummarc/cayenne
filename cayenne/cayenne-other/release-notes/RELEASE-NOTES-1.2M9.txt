Changes/New Features:

* Generated/Identity Columns - http://objectstyle.org/confluence/display/CAY/Generated+Columns
  - Derby support for generated columns
  - Modeler now allows to specify generated columns for PK only. Non-pk column can't be generated.
  
* DataDomain now implements OPPChannel.
  
* "DataContextFactory.createDataContext" method signature change. 
  Previously introduced "DataContextFactory.createDataContext(QueryEngine, ObjectStore)" 
  is replaced with "DataContextFactory.createDataContext(OPPChannel, ObjectStore)". The change
  of the custom factories should be trivial, as DataContext now has a corresponding constructor 
  and DataDomain implements OPPChannel.

* Oracle DATE type is now reverse engineered by default as JDBC TIMESTAMP, as it can store both 
  date and time info.
  
* DbRelationship.srcFkSnapshotWithTargetSnapshot(..) and DbRelationship.srcPkSnapshotWithTargetSnapshot
  no longer throw an exception when null values are found in primary key snapshot, recognizing that key
  generation may be deferred (case of DB-generated keys).
  
* Portable ObjectId:
  ObjectId is now used instead of recently introduced GlobalID within ObjectContext space (i.e. removal of 
  GlobalID only affects remote tier). Still there are substantial changes in the ObjectId itself. To make 
  it portable across the network, we no longer use Java Class as the main key within the id. Instead 
  ObjEntity name string is used for this purpose. 
  
  UPGRADE NOTE: it wasn't possible to phase out some of the old ObjectId API via deprecation, so methods 
  "getObjClass" and "getObjectClass" are removed completely. Constructors that take Class as the first argument
  are deprecated and will only work if entity naming follows CayenneModeler default conventions of using unqualified
  class name as the entity name.
 
* Thread-bound Transactions:
  QueryEngine.performQueries(Collection,OperationObserver resultConsumer,Transaction) is deprecated and no longer used 
  internally to further decouple layers in the access stack. Instead transaction initiator (either DataContext or a user)
  must bind an appropraite transaction before executing an operation (or use Transaction.performQueries(..) that does
  it internally). 
  UPGRADE NOTE: This change only affects users who implemented custom transactions.
