         <section name="Cayenne: Professional Object Relational Mapping">
        <p>Cayenne is a powerful, full-featured Java Object Relational Mapping framework. It is open source
        and completely free. One of the main Cayenne distinctions is that it comes with cross-platform 
        modeling GUI tools. This places Cayenne in the league of its own, making it a very attractive
        choice over both closed source commerical products and traditional "edit your own XML" open 
        source solutions.

        <p><img align="left" hspace="3" src="images/other/nhl_logo.gif"/> 
        After the initial trial of Cayenne last October, NHL
        switched all their public applications running at <a href="http://www.nhl.com">NHL.com</a>
        to use Cayenne. With the help from <a href="http://objectstyle.com">ObjectStyle</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.centralparksoftware.com/">Central Park Software</a> the site was successfully
        launched to production. Currently applications receive more than 5 million hits a day.

        <section name="About Cayenne">
        <p>Cayenne provides management of persistent Java objects mapped to relational databases, 
        single method call queries and updates (including atomic updates of all modified objects), 
        seamless integration of multiple databases into a single virtual data source. 
        Cayenne is distributed with CayenneModeler - a complete GUI mapping tool that supports 
        reverse-engineering of RDBMS schema, working with database mappings and generation of 
        Java source code for the persistent objects. Cayenne has been successfully deployed in 
        production environment on high volume sites and has a constantly growing international community.</p>
        
        <p>Cayenne is an open source project and we encourage the 
        community to participate in development, testing and writing documentation.
        This way we can produce a better product that will benefit both contributors
        and user community.</p>
